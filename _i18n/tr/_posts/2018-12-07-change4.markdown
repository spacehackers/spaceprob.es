The Chang'e 4 (嫦娥四号, "Moon goddess") lander and Yutu-2 (玉兔二号, "Jade Rabbit") rover are studying the geophysics of the Moon and carried with them a sealed container of the very first seeds to sprout on the Moon. Chang'e 4 was also the first space probe to softly land on the far side of the Moon. The lander and rover regularly communicate with Earth through talking to the <a href="/queqiao">Queqiao</a> (鹊桥) space probe. Chang'e 4's main objectives are to inspect lunar rocks and soil, conduct radio astronomy, and study the Sun and cosmic rays. Chang'e 4's sealed biological experiment contained a variety of plant seeds, yeast, and fruit fly eggs to test whether they could survive on the Moon. Photographic <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-46873526">evidence</a> showed the cottonseed successfully sprouted, but the experiment was terminated after nine days when it was no longer able to keep the container warm.
