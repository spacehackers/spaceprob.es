Voyager 2 is the oldest currently active space probe, having been launched into space on August 20, 1977, just a couple weeks before its identical twin, Voyager 1, was launched. Like Voyager 1, Voyager 2's main mission was to study both Jupiter and Saturn. At Jupiter, Voyager 2 discovered three new moons. After encountering Saturn, Voyager 2's mission was extended to visit Uranus and Neptune, where it discovered 10 new Uranian moons. To this day, Voyager 2 is the only space probe to have visited Uranus and Neptune, providing <a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/08/thirty-four-years-voyager-2-continues-explore/">invaluable insights</a> about the planets and their moons. Now in the interstellar phase of its mission, Voyager 2 is estimated to leave the solar system around 2016, carrying with it the <a href="/voyager1/">same golden record as Voyager 1</a>.
