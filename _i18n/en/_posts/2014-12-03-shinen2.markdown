Shin'en 2, also known as Abyss 2, is a polyhedron-shaped space probe on a mission to test a deep space communication technology. Shin'en 2's digital transponder will allow for amateur radio operators to interact with the probe. The lightweight space probe was built using carbon fiber reinforced plastic by students at the Kagoshima University and Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan. The probe was launched as a secondary payload aboard the rocket that carried <a href="/hayabusa2/">Hayabusa 2</a> to space. Shin'en 2 will operate in a heliocentric orbit, between Venus and Mars.
