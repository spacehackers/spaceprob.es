    <p>We love space probes to the Moon and beyond! <a href="http://spaceprob.es">Spaceprob.es</a> catalogs the active human-made machines that freckle our solar system and dot our galaxy. For each space probe, we've affectionately crafted a short-and-sweet summary as well as handpicked geeky hyperlinks we think are worth exploring. Where possible, we utilize data from the <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html">Deep Space Network</a>.</p>

                <a href="http://twitter.com/basilleaf">Lisa Ballard</a> is a human that launched from California and maintains an orbit around the East Bay. Ballard was sent on a mission to make planetary data accessible and support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The human regularly sends signals to the Rings Node Planetary Data System at the SETI Institute, Spacehack.org and Seahack.org. Ballard’s voyage across the solar system has traversed the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the peaks of Mount Diablo. Wherever Ballard goes, she carries her trusty scuba gear, hiking supplies, cats and yoga mat for performing surveys of the planet’s landscape.
